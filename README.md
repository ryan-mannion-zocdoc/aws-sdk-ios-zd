# AWS SDK

* Clone https://github.com/ryan-mannion-zocdoc/aws-sdk-ios
* From the working directory of the cloned `aws-sdk-ios` repository, run: `../aws-sdk-ios-zd/build.sh` (replace `aws-sdk-ios-zd` as appropriate if you've cloned _this_ repo to a different directory)
* On success, the build script will emit `.xcframework`s into an `xcframework` directory. Move them one level up and commit/push them.
